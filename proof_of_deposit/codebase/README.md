# Cambridge Cryptgraphic's Codebase

We have developed the following:

1. contracts - solidity smart contracts that have been deployed on Alfajores testnet
2. webapp - a WebApp to interact with deployed smart contracts
3. marketcap_model - formal analysis of our tech written in latex, along with python simulation code 

## Credits

This WebApp uses [plock.fi](https://github.com/AlexBHarley/plock.fi) as a framework.

## Using the WebApp

1. Install npm packages via `npm install`
2. Run the WebApp locally `yarn run dev` (should start on http://localhost:3001)
3. Generate a random address and private key (can use https://vanity-eth.tk/)
4. Fund your address via (Celo's faucet)[https://celo.org/build/faucet]
5. Connect your wallet
